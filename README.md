## Unofficial Medium library

This is a project which intends to create a simple library in golang for 
reading state in medium.com website, from lists, users and tags.

The end goal is to create a simple REST API to obtain data programatically

### How it came to be

This is a personal project born because I wanted to extract information about my
articles in medium.com to import it into my personal website.

So I was searching for an alternative, until I encountered an unoficial Medium API that had a lot of 
features, but I had some problems with it, first in not open-sourced, you need to register in a website 
called rapidAPI, in the free plan you have 100 free calls, and after that it becomes <strong>4 cents</strong> per call!!, 
by the way that it's structured you need to make 3 calls to have the publications of a user, if you need to parse
through a list of the authors of your company, the bill could ramp up pretty quickly.

I know that this is very useful and can make money with this but I don't think this
is the way to do this.
