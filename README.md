## Unofficial Medium library

This is a project which intends to create a simple library in golang for 
reading state in medium.com website, from lists, users and tags.

The end goal is to create a simple REST API to obtain data programatically

### How it came to be

This is a personal project born because I wanted to extract information about my
articles in medium.com to import it into my personal website.

So I was searching for an alternative from the official medium API as it is deprecated, until I encountered an unoficial Medium API that had a lot of 
features, but I had some problems with it, first in not open-sourced, you need to register in a website 
called rapidAPI, in the free plan you have 100 free calls, and after that it becomes <strong>4 cents</strong> per call!!, 
After some calls the bill could be  

I know that this is very useful and can make money with this but I don't think this
is the way to do this. 


## This is a Project under development ðŸ”§

There's some features to be implemented in the library, like obtaining tags of the topics of the user and the articles.
