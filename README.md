## Unofficial Medium API

This is a personal project born because I wanted to extract information about my
articles in medium.com to import it into my personal website.

I saw an official Medium API, but it was deprecated ðŸ’€.

So I was searching for an alternative, until I encountered an unoficial Medium API that had a lot of 
features, but I had some problems with it, first in not open-sourced, you need to register in a website 
called rapidAPI, I know that this is very useful and can make money with this but I don't think this
is the way to do this.


## This is a Project under development

This is not production ready, the endgoal is to create different endpoints to obtain
Articles, Users, Topics and Lists
